## My process
I used a total of 12 hours including bed-time for the completion of this project. Just like I always do, I start with drafting the box-model for project both on paper and in mind. After that, I write the HTML code for the project. I prefer tackling the css after the completion of the HTML. The CSS part started well until it was time for me to initiate the active mode of certain elements. The one that gave me the problem was that of the main image. I had to go back to my drawing board to revise CSS positioning which I learnt in a crooked manner years before. It was nice process though. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I started working on making responsive sites earlier this month. So,at first making it functional for a mobile device was difficult but rewarding. I also learned that making use of percentages when defining measurements is preferable due to the vast number of differnt screen sizes available now. 

### Continued development
So, ahead of my next Frontend project, I'll study the concept of positioning in CSS and work on my skills for responsive pages.

### Useful resources
- [CSS Position property by Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-position-property-explained/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Positioning. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
